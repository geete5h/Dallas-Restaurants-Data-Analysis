# Dallas-Restaurants-Data-Analysis

## Overview of the Project

In this project, I have used the Dallas Restaurants dataset in order to generate insights for the target firm OpenTable. I have used Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to generate predictive and classification models.

A Four Stage Project as shown above.

**Stage 1:** First Stage is mostly about Identifying, acquiring, understanding and cleaning the data. Once completed the target firm is identified.

**Stage 2:** This involved identifying predictors and outcome variables.

**Stage 3:** This stage comprises of building different predictive models and choose the best of top 3 high performance models.

**Stage 4:** This involves Drawing out Insights from the chosen model and come up with actionable business recommendations for the target firm.

## **Data Description**

The dataset chosen for the term project was acquired from Dallas Open Data Platform.  Dallas Open Data is an invaluable resource for anyone to easily access data published by the City.
